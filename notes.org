** TODO thingy to get sim accuracy
   - run the simulation over & over at different time steps and look at eg 5-6 seconds and compare positions. narrow in on a ts that gives <N% variance or something
** TODO report ticks / sec (perf) and using dt give a real-world time
** TODO planet path breadcrumbs

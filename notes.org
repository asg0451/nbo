* TODOS
** TODO c++20
*** TODO async, atomic shared pty
** DONE end threads via a (shared?) future
** TODO parallelize simulation per tick?
** TODO optimize simulation generally
** DONE move simulation out of space
** TODO google build / deps system
** TODO leverage tl lib - tl::optional, .map, .and_then
** TODO thread exception handling
   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/233127/how-can-i-propagate-exceptions-between-threads
** TODO thingy to get sim accuracy
   - run the simulation over & over at different time steps and look at eg 5-6 seconds and compare positions. narrow in on a ts that gives <N% variance or something
** DONE planet path breadcrumbs
** TODO planet velocity indicators?
** TODO real graphics
** TODO 3d
** TODO asserts
** TODO move simulation, dt out of space. is space even a good abstraction? probably not
** TODO use clang-tidy (apt install clang-tidy)
   - clang-tidy -header-filter=.* -checks=*,-fuchsia* ../src/space.cpp
** TODO testing -- what tools? are things well factored for testing?
** TODO better planet init system -- ez for users ie me
** TODO REFACTOR sim stats. i want to display them in render threat, i want it to have access to dt, or at least something that prints it should, so it can calc sim time to real time ratio (sim time per tick (dt) / real sec per tick (last_duration_micro) )
** TODO write states to a file. exception handling
** TODO make vec2 constructor able to take an initializer list (i think it already can but why)
** Tooling
*** TODO yasnippit type thing for inserting rule of 5 special function declarations or smthn
*** TODO all member vars get underscore at end
*** DONE optimize sim a bit
*** DONE refactor threader to be templated


* tools etc
** clang-format on only a block?
** clang-modernize
** clang-check?, clang-cl?, clang-replace?, clang-tidy?
** clang++ --analyze -Xanalyzer -analyzer-output=text x.cpp
** clang++ -g -fsantize=address{,-full (expensive)} (for debug build?)
** clang++ -g -fsantize=thread (for debug build?)
** clang++ -g -fsantize=memory (for debug build?) (expensive)
** clang++ -g -fsantize=behavior (for debug build?)
** more??


* notes
** override keyword
** virtual destructor
** "dont use delete as the instigator for the synchronized destruction of an object"
** perf
   - sudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict'
   - sudo bash -c 'echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid '
   - make && perf record -g --call-graph dwarf ./bin/nbo
   - perf report
** std::copy (implement as friend for stl algs?), std::exchange. copy-and-swap for assignment op overloads (then need to write a swap)
*** TODO copy from slide @ https://youtu.be/7Qgd9B1KuMQ?t=2482 (also operator= should be noexcept and there should be one by ref, one by rvalue ref instead of his copy= idiom)
** rule of 3/5/4.5, rule of 0
** decltype(thing) useful for lambdas
** RVO
*** dont std::move in return
*** move is usually a fallback
*** has to be decidable at construction time (?)
*** prvalues (temp) or stack objects only. fn parameters dont get it (you have to construct it yourself)
*** if ternary -- both cases have to be rvalues?
*** map.emplace(k, v)



* questions
** lock_guard vs unique_lock

* cmake/conan
** how to
*** bear
    bear make etc from build, mv to proj root
*** install deps
    from build/: conan install ..
*** add deps
    add to conanfile.txt
*** compile
    after running cmake first time
    from build/: make
*** add a new file
    add it to src/CMakeLists.txt, then rerun cmake
*** run cmake
    from build/: cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..

* add to dotfile installs
  - clang
  - clang-tidy
  - clang-tools
  - bear
  - cmake
  - linux-tools-common
  - linux-tools-generic
  - linux-tools-generic
